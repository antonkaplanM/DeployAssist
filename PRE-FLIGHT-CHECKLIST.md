# Pre-Flight Checklist - React Migration

Complete these items BEFORE starting implementation.

## 📋 Decision Making

### 1. Feature Prioritization
Which features do users use most? Migrate these first.

- [ ] Reviewed analytics/usage data (if available)
- [ ] Talked to users about most-used features
- [ ] Prioritized feature list created
- [ ] Decided on migration order

**Suggested order (adjust based on usage):**
1. Login + Auth (required first)
2. Dashboard (most visited)
3. [Your most-used feature]
4. [Your second most-used feature]
5. ...rest

### 2. Timeline & Resources
Be realistic about time commitment.

- [ ] Estimated time per phase
- [ ] Allocated dedicated time blocks
- [ ] Identified who's working on migration
- [ ] Set realistic deadlines
- [ ] Planned for testing time
- [ ] Scheduled user acceptance testing

**Questions:**
- Full-time on migration? Or part-time?
- Solo developer or team?
- Hard deadline?

### 3. Risk Assessment

- [ ] Backup/snapshot of current production
- [ ] Database backup confirmed
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring plan in place
- [ ] User communication plan ready

### 4. Technical Preparation

- [ ] Git branch strategy decided
- [ ] Development environment ready
- [ ] Node.js/npm versions confirmed
- [ ] Package manager chosen (npm)
- [ ] Code editor configured (VS Code recommended)

## 🔧 Environment Setup

### 1. Version Control
- [ ] Current code committed
- [ ] Working directory clean
- [ ] Created migration branch: `git checkout -b feature/react-migration`
- [ ] Pushed branch to remote (if using remote repo)

### 2. Dependencies Check
```powershell
node --version   # Should be v16+
npm --version    # Should be v7+
```

- [ ] Node.js version adequate (v16+)
- [ ] npm version adequate (v7+)
- [ ] Enough disk space (at least 1GB free)

### 3. Backend Preparation

- [ ] Backend runs successfully: `node app.js`
- [ ] Can access http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Can login to current app
- [ ] API endpoints working
- [ ] Database connected

### 4. Documentation Review

- [ ] Read MIGRATION-PLAN.md
- [ ] Read setup-react-migration.md  
- [ ] Understand the architecture
- [ ] Questions answered or noted

## 📝 Before Starting Phase 0

### 1. Clean Workspace
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications
- [ ] Ensure stable internet (for npm installs)
- [ ] Set aside 30-60 minutes uninterrupted

### 2. Backup Current State
```powershell
# Create a backup of public folder
Copy-Item -Path "public" -Destination "public-backup-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd')" -Recurse
```

- [ ] Backup created
- [ ] Backup tested (files exist)

### 3. Terminal Setup
You'll need 2 terminal windows:
- Terminal 1: Backend server
- Terminal 2: React dev server

- [ ] Terminals ready
- [ ] Know how to start both servers

### 4. Editor Setup (Optional but Recommended)

**VS Code Extensions:**
- [ ] ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
- [ ] Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- [ ] ESLint
- [ ] Prettier

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Phase 0

After setup, you should have:
- [ ] React app runs on http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Backend runs on http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Login page loads in React app
- [ ] Can successfully login
- [ ] Redirects to dashboard after login
- [ ] Can logout
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Tailwind styles working

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: npm install fails
**Solution:** 
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete node_modules: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules`
- Reinstall: `npm install`

### Issue: Port 3000 already in use
**Solution:**
- Kill process on port 3000
- Or change port in vite.config.js

### Issue: API calls fail with CORS error
**Solution:**
- Add CORS middleware to backend (see setup doc)
- Check Vite proxy configuration
- Restart both servers

### Issue: Styles not loading
**Solution:**
- Check Tailwind config paths
- Ensure `@tailwind` directives in index.css
- Restart dev server

## 📞 Help & Resources

**If stuck:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check terminal output for errors
3. Review setup-react-migration.md
4. Google the specific error message
5. Check React Router docs
6. Check Vite docs
