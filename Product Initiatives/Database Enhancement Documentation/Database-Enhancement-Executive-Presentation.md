### Slide 2: Current State Challenges
**Pain Points with Current Architecture**

🔄 **Performance Issues**
- Every request hits external APIs (Salesforce, JIRA)
- No caching = repeated expensive calls
- Users experience 2-5 second load times

💸 **Cost Inefficiencies**
- High API usage costs from Salesforce/JIRA
- No data persistence = lost work on session timeout
- Scalability bottlenecks with concurrent users

📊 **Limited Analytics**
- No historical data tracking
- Cannot measure user behavior or feature adoption
- Reactive vs. proactive issue resolution

🔐 **Compliance Gaps**
- No audit trails for data access
- Cannot track user activities
- Limited security monitoring capabilities
