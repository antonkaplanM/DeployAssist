# ✅ Verify Old App is Running on Port 5000

## 🧪 Quick Test

Open your browser and try:

### **http://localhost:5000**

---

## ✅ What You Should See

If the old app is running correctly, you'll see:
- **Login page** (if not logged in)
- **Dashboard page** (if already authenticated with a cookie)
- The original JavaScript Single Page Application

The page should have the **old design** (not the new React design).

## 🔍 How to Verify It's the OLD App

### Visual Differences:
1. **OLD App:**
   - Slightly older styling
   - Navigation might look different
   - Sidebar may have different icons/layout

2. **NEW App** (on port 8080):
   - Modern, cleaner design
   - React components
   - Smoother animations

### Quick Test:
1. Open **http://localhost:5000** (old)
2. Open **http://localhost:8080** (new)
3. Compare the Dashboard pages side-by-side

## ❓ Still Not Working?

### Check 1: Is Port 5000 Actually in Use?
In PowerShell, run:
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
```

If you see output, port 5000 is in use. If not, the server didn't start.

### Check 2: Look for Server Output
The terminal should show:
```
🚀 Server is running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
📁 Serving OLD JavaScript app from ./public
🌐 URL: http://localhost:5000
```

### Check 3: Try Another Port
If 5000 still doesn't work, let me know and we can try port 4000 or 8000.

## 🎯 Next Steps Once Working

1. **Compare Provisioning Requests:**
   - OLD: http://localhost:5000 → Provisioning → Provisioning Requests
   - NEW: http://localhost:8080 → Provisioning → Provisioning Requests

2. **Verify all 11 columns show in BOTH**

3. **Test features:**
   - Click product buttons (Models/Data/Apps)
   - Check validation badges
   - Try actions menu
   - Export CSV
