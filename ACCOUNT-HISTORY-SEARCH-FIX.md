# Account History Search - Fix Applied

## Problem
When typing a PS record or account name in the search box, no dropdown options were appearing.

## Root Cause
The API returns search results in this format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "results": {
    "technicalRequests": [
      { "Name": "PS-4327", "Account__c": "Bank of America", "Id": "..." }
    ],
    "accounts": [
      { "Account__c": "Bank of America Corporation", "Id": "..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

But the React component was expecting `results` to be a flat array and looking for `Account_Name__c` field.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Search Result Parsing
Updated `handleSearch()` to properly parse the nested structure:
- Extracts PS-IDs from `results.technicalRequests`
- Extracts unique accounts from `results.accounts`
- Creates a unified dropdown with both types

### 2. Enhanced Dropdown Display
- **PS-IDs**: Show with clock icon (üïê) and display as "PS-XXXX - Account Name"
- **Accounts**: Show with building icon (üè¢) and display account name
- Added "Technical Team Request" subtitle for PS-IDs

### 3. Fixed Account Selection
When a user selects an item:
- If PS-ID selected: Use the account name from the PS record
- If Account selected: Use the account name directly
- Loads all provisioning requests for that account

### 4. Added Debug Logging
Console logs help track:
- Search results from API
- Parsed search results
- Selected account/PS-ID
- Loaded request count

## Test Now

1. **Open**: http://localhost:8080/analytics/account-history

2. **Search by Account Name**:
   - Type: "Bank"
   - Should see dropdown with:
     - üïê PS-4327 - Bank of America Corporation
     - üïê PS-4280 - Bank of America Corporation
     - üè¢ Bank of America Corporation
     - etc.

3. **Search by PS-ID**:
   - Type: "PS-4327"
   - Should see dropdown with:
     - üïê PS-4327 - Bank of America Corporation

4. **Select Any Result**:
   - Click on a dropdown item
   - Should load provisioning request table
   - Should show all requests for that account

## Browser Console Output

Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab to see:
```
[AccountHistory] Search result: { success: true, results: {...} }
[AccountHistory] Parsed search results: [{ type: 'ps-id', name: 'PS-4327', ... }]
