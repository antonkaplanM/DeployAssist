# Account History Page - Redesign Complete

## Summary
The Account History page has been completely redesigned to match the old app's implementation, focusing on provisioning request history rather than package change analytics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Service Layer (`accountHistoryService.js`)
**Old Implementation:**
- Fetched package changes from `/api/analytics/package-changes/by-account`
- Displayed timeline of upgrades/downgrades

**New Implementation:**
- Fetches provisioning requests from `/api/provisioning/requests`
- Returns full request history with all details
- Added `compareRequests()` function for side-by-side comparison

### 2. UI Component (`AccountHistory.jsx`)
**Old Implementation:**
- Visual timeline with dots and connecting lines
- Showed upgrade/downgrade badges
- Simple date range filter

**New Implementation:**
- Full data table with sortable columns
- Multiple filter controls:
  - Deployment number dropdown
  - Show limit selector (5/10/25/50/all)
  - Product changes toggle
- Checkbox selection for comparison
- Side-by-side comparison modal
- Actions menu per row

### 3. Table Columns
The new implementation displays:
- ☑️ Select checkbox
- # Row number
- Request ID (PS-XXXX)
- Date (formatted timestamp)
- Deployment Number
- Tenant Name
- Status (colored badge)
- Type
- Products
- Actions (dropdown menu)

### 4. Features Added

#### Filtering
- **Deployment Filter**: Dropdown populated with unique deployment numbers from requests
- **Show Limit**: Control how many requests to display (Latest 5/10/25/50 or All)
- **Product Changes Toggle**: Show/hide product details in expanded rows

#### Comparison
- Select up to 2 requests using checkboxes
- "View Side-by-Side" button becomes enabled when 2 are selected
- Modal displays both requests side-by-side for easy comparison

#### Account Summary
- Shows total request count
- Displays date range of all requests
- Clear selection button to reset

### 5. Authentication Fix for E2E Tests
**Problem**: Tests were failing after multiple login attempts

**Solution**: Created global authentication setup
- `auth.setup.ts`: Logs in once before all tests
- Saves authentication state to `.auth/user.json`
- All tests reuse the saved session
- No more repeated login attempts

**Files Modified:**
- `tests/e2e/auth.setup.ts` (new)
- `playwright.config.ts` (updated with setup project)
- `.gitignore` (added `.auth/` folder)

## Testing

### Run E2E Tests
```bash
# Run all tests (auth setup runs automatically)
npm run test:e2e

# Run Account History tests specifically
npm run test:e2e -- account-history

# Run in headed mode to see the browser
npm run test:e2e -- account-history --headed
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Search by account name (e.g., "Bank of America")
- [ ] Search by PS-ID (e.g., "PS-4331")
- [ ] Filter by deployment number
- [ ] Change show limit (5/10/25/50/all)
- [ ] Toggle product changes display
- [ ] Select 2 requests and view side-by-side comparison
- [ ] Use actions menu on a request
- [ ] Clear selection and return to empty state
