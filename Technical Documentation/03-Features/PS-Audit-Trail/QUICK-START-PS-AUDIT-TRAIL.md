# Quick Start: PS Audit Trail

## ðŸš€ Get Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Database (2 minutes)

```bash
# Initialize the audit trail schema
node setup-ps-audit-trail.js
```

**What this does**:
- Creates `ps_audit_trail` table
- Creates `ps_audit_log` table
- Sets up helper functions
- Creates optimized indexes

âœ… **Success**: You should see "PS Audit Trail setup complete!"

---

### Step 2: Load Existing Data (5-10 minutes)

```bash
# Pre-populate with PS records from the last 2 years
node pre-populate-ps-audit.js
```

**What this does**:
- Fetches all PS records from Salesforce (last 2 years)
- Creates initial snapshots for each record
- May take several minutes depending on data volume

âœ… **Success**: You should see statistics like:
```
Total Records: 1,234
Successfully Captured: 1,234
Duration: 45.23s
```

---

### Step 3: Add to Entitlements (30 seconds)

```bash
# Add the page to the navigation system
node add-audit-trail-to-entitlements.js
```

**What this does**:
- Adds "Audit Trail" to the Provisioning menu
- Grants access to Admin and User roles

âœ… **Success**: Refresh your browser - you should now see "Audit Trail" under Provisioning!

---

## ðŸ“Š Using the Audit Trail

### Access the Page
1. Navigate to **Provisioning â†’ Audit Trail**
2. You'll see statistics at the top showing:
   - Total PS Records tracked
   - Total Snapshots captured
   - Status Changes detected
   - Last Capture time

### Search for a Record
1. Enter a PS record name (e.g., `PS-12345`) or Salesforce ID
2. Click **Search** or press Enter
3. View:
   - âœ¨ **Record Info**: Current status and account
   - ðŸ“ˆ **Status Timeline**: Visual history of changes
   - ðŸ“‹ **Complete Table**: All snapshots with details

---

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Tracking (Optional but Recommended)

### Option A: Manual Capture
Run this command whenever you want to check for changes:
```bash
node capture-ps-changes.js
```

### Option B: Automated Capture (Recommended)

**Windows (Task Scheduler)**:
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Trigger: Daily, repeat every 15 minutes
4. Action: `node.exe capture-ps-changes.js`
5. Start in: Your app directory

**Linux/Mac (Cron)**:
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs every 15 minutes)
*/15 * * * * cd /path/to/app && node capture-ps-changes.js >> logs/audit-capture.log 2>&1
```

## âœ… Verification

### Check It's Working

1. **Statistics Show Data**:
   - Go to Audit Trail page
   - Top stats should show non-zero numbers

2. **Search Works**:
   - Pick any PS record name from the Provisioning Monitor
   - Search for it in Audit Trail
   - You should see results

3. **Check Database**:

   ```
   Should return a number > 0

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No records found when searching"

**Solution**:
1. Verify pre-population ran: `node pre-populate-ps-audit.js`
2. Check if Salesforce is authenticated

**Solution**:
1. Run: `node add-audit-trail-to-entitlements.js`
2. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Verify you're logged in with correct role

### Problem: "Statistics show 0 records"
