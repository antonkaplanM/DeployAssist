## Configuration Changes Made

### 1. Updated `.env` File
Only the Salesforce credentials were updated in the existing `.env` file:

**Before (Sandbox):**
```env
SF_LOGIN_URL=https://riskms--rmsqa.sandbox.my.salesforce.com
SF_CLIENT_ID=<SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID_FROM_ENV_FILE>
SF_CLIENT_SECRET=<SANDBOX_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_ENV_FILE>
```

**After (Production):**
```env
SF_LOGIN_URL=https://riskms.my.salesforce.com
SF_CLIENT_ID=<PRODUCTION_CLIENT_ID_FROM_ENV_FILE>
SF_CLIENT_SECRET=<PRODUCTION_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_ENV_FILE>
```

**⚠️ Security Note:** The actual credentials are stored in the `.env` file (not committed to git).
See `env.example` for the required environment variable format.

**✅ All other integrations preserved:**
- Atlassian API configuration ✓
- Application configuration ✓
- Database configuration ✓

### 2. Cleared Cached Tokens
Deleted `.salesforce_auth.json` to remove stale sandbox authentication tokens.

## Answer to Your Question

### **Does the user whose account is being used need to be logged in?**

**Answer: NO** ✅

The integration uses **Client Credentials Flow**, which is **server-to-server** authentication:

1. ✅ **No user login required** - User can log out safely
2. ✅ **Client ID and Client Secret are sufficient** for authentication
3. ✅ **Tokens refresh automatically** without user interaction
4. ✅ **No browser/session dependency**
5. ✅ **Works continuously** even when user is logged out

The system authenticates using the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** stored in `.env`, not user credentials.

---

## Test Script

Created `test-sf-prod.js` for quick connection verification:

```bash
node test-sf-prod.js
```

This script:
- Validates environment configuration
- Tests Client Credentials authentication
- Verifies API connectivity
- Confirms PS Request object access
- Shows sample production data

---

## API Endpoints Ready

All Salesforce-integrated API endpoints are now connected to **production**:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/api/provisioning/requests` | Query Professional Services Requests |
| `/api/provisioning/search` | Search PS requests and accounts |
| `/api/provisioning/requests/:id` | Get specific PS request details |
| `/api/provisioning/removals` | Track product removals |
| `/api/analytics/request-types-week` | Analytics by request type |
| `/api/analytics/validation-trend` | Validation failure trends |
| `/api/validation/errors` | Validation errors monitoring |
| `/api/customer-products` | Customer product information |
| `/api/expiration/monitor` | Product expiration monitoring |

---

## How to Start the Application

```bash
npm start
```

The application will automatically:
1. Load production credentials from `.env`
2. Authenticate with Salesforce using Client Credentials
3. Cache the access token to `.salesforce_auth.json`
4. Refresh the token automatically when it expires
5. Connect to: **https://riskms.my.salesforce.com**

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Authentication Fails:
1. Verify Consumer Key and Secret in `.env`
2. Check Connected App OAuth settings in Salesforce:
   - Client Credentials Flow must be enabled
   - Proper OAuth scopes assigned
   - User permissions configured
3. Check for IP restrictions in Salesforce
4. Delete `.salesforce_auth.json` and retry

### To Re-authenticate:
```bash
# Delete cached token
Remove-Item .salesforce_auth.json -Force

# Test connection (will create new token)
node test-sf-prod.js
```

## Security Notes

- ⚠️ `.env` file contains sensitive credentials - **DO NOT commit to git**
- ✅ `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ `.salesforce_auth.json` is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ All other integration credentials preserved
