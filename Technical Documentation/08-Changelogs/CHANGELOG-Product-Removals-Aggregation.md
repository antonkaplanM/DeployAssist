# Product Removals Widget - Category Aggregation Implementation

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Feature:** Aggregated Product Removals with Category Modal View  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Enhanced the Product Removals widget on the Dashboard to aggregate all PS Record entitlement line items into the same categories (Models, Data, Apps) used on the Provisioning Monitor page. Products are now displayed as clickable category cards that open a detailed modal view, providing a consistent user experience across the application.

## Key Changes

### 1. Category Aggregation Logic

The widget now aggregates all removed products across all PS requests in the selected timeframe into three categories:

- **Models** (Blue) - Analytical models and related products
- **Data** (Green) - Data feeds, datasets, and data-related entitlements  
- **Apps** (Purple) - Applications and app-related entitlements

**Benefits:**
- Provides a high-level summary at a glance
- Eliminates duplicate product listings
- Groups products by type for easier analysis
- Shows unique product count across all removal events

### 2. Visual Category Cards

Replaced individual removal cards with three interactive category summary cards:

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│   Models    │    Data     │    Apps     │
│     🔍      │     💾      │     📱      │
│     15      │      8      │      3      │
│ Click to    │ Click to    │ Click to    │
│ view details│ view details│ view details│
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**Features:**
- Color-coded borders and backgrounds matching category
- Large number display for quick scanning
- Hover effects for interactive feedback
- Disabled state for categories with zero removals
- Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 3 columns desktop)

### 3. Category Detail Modal

When a category card is clicked, a modal displays:

**Modal Header:**
- Category-specific icon and title
- Count of unique products in that category
- Color-coded header background

**Modal Body:**
- Information banner explaining what removals represent
- Sortable table with columns:
  - **Product Code** - Unique identifier
  - **Product Name** - Human-readable name
  - **Removed In PS Records** - Clickable badges showing which PS requests removed this product

**Modal Footer:**
- Close button
- Keyboard support (ESC key to close)

**Interactive Features:**
- Click PS record badges to navigate to Provisioning Monitor with exact match filtering
- Modal auto-closes when navigating to another page
- Backdrop click to close
- Smooth animations and transitions

### 4. Source Tracking

The implementation tracks which PS requests each product was removed from:

```javascript
removalSources.get(productCode) → [
  { currentRequest: {...}, previousRequest: {...} },
  { currentRequest: {...}, previousRequest: {...} }
]
```

This enables:
- Cross-referencing removals with specific PS records
- Quick navigation to related requests
- Understanding removal patterns across multiple accounts

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Functions

#### `displayRemovalsResults(data)`
**Location:** `public/script.js` (lines 6220-6421)

**Changes:**
- Added aggregation logic to combine products from all requests
- Implemented unique product tracking using Map data structure
- Created category cards with dynamic counts
- Added JSON serialization for modal data passing

#### New Functions

**`showRemovalCategoryModal(categoryType, products, sourcesArray)`**
**Location:** `public/script.js` (lines 6443-6595)

Creates and displays the category detail modal with:
- Dynamic category configuration (colors, icons, titles)
- Product table with source tracking
- Clickable PS record badges
- Escape key handler

**`closeRemovalCategoryModal(event)`**
**Location:** `public/script.js` (lines 6597-6609)

Handles modal cleanup:
- Removes modal from DOM
- Restores body scroll
- Cleans up event listeners

**`handleRemovalModalEscape(event)`**
**Location:** `public/script.js` (lines 6611-6619)

Keyboard support for ESC key to close modal.

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- Individual cards for each PS request
- Products shown as inline badges
- Limited ability to see patterns
- Requires scrolling through multiple cards
- No easy way to see unique products

### After:
- Single view with three category cards
- Clear counts at a glance
- Modal view for detailed analysis
- See all unique products in each category
- Direct navigation to related PS records
- Consistent with Monitor page design

## Usage Guide

### Viewing Removals

1. **Dashboard** → Product Removals widget
2. Select timeframe (1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month, 1 Year)
3. View category summary cards showing counts
4. Click any category card to see detailed modal

### Modal Interactions

- **View Details**: Click category card (Models, Data, or Apps)
- **Navigate to PS Record**: Click any blue badge in "Removed In PS Records" column
- **Close Modal**: 
  - Click "Close" button
  - Press ESC key
  - Click backdrop (outside modal)

### Understanding the Data

**Summary Line:**
```
15 unique products removed across 8 PS requests
```
- **Unique products** - Distinct product codes (duplicates removed)
- **PS requests** - Number of PS records with removals in timeframe

**Category Cards:**
- Show count of unique products in each category
- Disabled (grayed out) when count is 0
- Hover effect indicates clickability

## Integration Points

### Consistent with Monitor Page

The implementation follows the same patterns used in the Provisioning Monitor:

1. **Category Icons** - Identical SVG icons for Models/Data/Apps
2. **Color Scheme** - Blue/Green/Purple matching Monitor page
3. **Modal Structure** - Similar layout and functionality
4. **PS Record Badges** - Same styling as Monitor page badges
5. **Navigation Pattern** - Uses `viewPSRecordExact()` for consistency

### Navigation Flow

```
Dashboard
  └─ Product Removals Widget
      └─ Category Card (Click)
          └─ Modal with Products
              └─ PS Record Badge (Click)
                  └─ Provisioning Monitor (Filtered View)
```

## Code Quality

### Best Practices Implemented

✅ **Data Aggregation** - Efficient Map-based deduplication  
✅ **Event Cleanup** - Proper listener removal on modal close  
✅ **Escape Key Support** - Keyboard accessibility  
✅ **Responsive Design** - Grid layout adapts to screen size  
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of missing data  
✅ **HTML Escaping** - Security protection against XSS  
✅ **Consistent Styling** - Matches existing design system  

### Performance Considerations

- Minimal DOM manipulation
- Event delegation where possible
- Efficient data structures (Map for O(1) lookups)
- JSON serialization only when needed
- Modal created on-demand, destroyed on close

## Testing Checklist

✅ Widget loads with correct timeframe default  
✅ Category cards display accurate counts  
✅ Cards disabled when count is 0  
✅ Modal opens on category click  
✅ Modal displays correct products  
✅ PS record badges are clickable  
✅ Navigation to Monitor works correctly  
✅ ESC key closes modal  
✅ Backdrop click closes modal

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

2. **Filtering** - Filter products by name/code within modal
3. **Export** - Download removal data as CSV/Excel
4. **Trend Analysis** - Show removal trends over time
5. **Account Grouping** - Group removals by account in modal
6. **Comparison View** - Compare removals across timeframes

## Summary

The Product Removals widget now provides a clean, aggregated view of removed products with an intuitive category-based interface. Users can quickly understand removal patterns and drill down into details when needed, all while maintaining consistency with the rest of the application's design patterns.

**Impact:** Improved data visibility, reduced cognitive load, and faster analysis of product removal trends across Professional Services requests.
