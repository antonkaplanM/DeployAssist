# Product Modal Grouping Enhancement

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Feature**: Enhanced product modal with smart grouping and expandable rows

## Overview

Enhanced the Product modal on the Monitor page and Account History page to automatically consolidate products with the same name but different dates. This improves readability and reduces visual clutter when multiple instances of the same product exist with varying date ranges.

## Changes Made

### 1. Product Grouping Logic (`public/script.js`)

Modified the `renderProductItems()` function to:
- **Group products by name**: Products with identical `productCode` values are now automatically grouped together
- **Calculate date ranges**: For each group, the system calculates:
  - Earliest start date across all instances
  - Latest end date across all instances
- **Preserve all data**: Individual product instances are retained and accessible via expansion

### 2. Expandable Row Interface

Added interactive UI elements:
- **Main row (consolidated view)**: Shows the product name with combined date range
- **Instance badge**: Displays the number of instances (e.g., "3 instances") for grouped products
- **Expand icon**: Right-pointing chevron that rotates 90° when expanded
- **Child rows**: Individual product instances displayed beneath the main row when expanded
- **Visual hierarchy**: Child rows are indented and styled with alternating background colors

### 3. Visual Enhancements

#### Main Row Features:
- Cursor changes to pointer for expandable rows
- Hover state provides visual feedback
- Bold product name for grouped items
- Blue badge showing instance count
- Date range shows earliest start to latest end

#### Child Row Features:
- Gray background for clear visual separation
- Numbered indicators (1, 2, 3...) for each instance
- Individual dates for each product instance
- Indented layout for hierarchy
- Smooth animation when expanding/collapsing

#### Validation Support:
- Warning icons for validation issues (both grouped and individual)
- Red highlighting for products with validation failures
- Tooltip messages explaining validation issues

### 4. CSS Styling (`public/styles.css`)

Added new styles:
```css
.group-row              /* Main expandable row styling */
.child-row              /* Child row styling with animation */
.expand-icon            /* Smooth rotation transition */
.bg-red-25              /* Light red background for validation issues */
.bg-blue-50             /* Light blue background for instance badge */
```

### 5. JavaScript Functions

Added new function:
```javascript
toggleProductGroup(groupId)
```
- Handles expand/collapse behavior
- Toggles visibility of child rows
- Rotates expand icon
- Uses data attributes to link parent and child rows

## Usage

### Viewing Grouped Products

1. **Open Product Modal**: Click on any product badge (Models, Data, or Apps) in:
   - Provisioning Monitor page
   - Account History page

2. **Identify Grouped Products**: Look for products with:
   - A blue badge showing instance count (e.g., "3 instances")
   - A right-pointing chevron icon

3. **Expand to View Details**: Click anywhere on the grouped row to reveal individual instances

4. **View Individual Dates**: Each instance shows its specific start and end dates

5. **Collapse Back**: Click the row again to hide individual instances

### Single Product Behavior

Products that appear only once are displayed normally without grouping:
- No expand icon
- No instance badge
- Direct display of product information

## Technical Details

### Data Structure

Each product group maintains:
```javascript
{
    productCode: string,        // Product name/code
    items: Array,               // All individual instances
    minStartDate: string,       // Earliest start date
    maxEndDate: string,         // Latest end date
    defaultItem: Object         // First item's data for other fields
}
```

### Grouping Algorithm

1. Iterate through all products
2. Create a Map with productCode as key
3. For each product:
   - Add to existing group or create new group
   - Update minimum start date
   - Update maximum end date
4. Preserve original index for validation lookups

### Compatibility

- Works with all product types: Models, Data, Apps
- Maintains existing validation highlighting
- Preserves package info helper functionality
- Compatible with sorting functionality
- Supports all field variations (productCode, product_code, ProductCode, etc.)

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Reduced clutter**: Multiple instances of the same product show as one line
- **Clear overview**: See date range at a glance (earliest start to latest end)
- **Detailed access**: Expand to see all individual instances when needed
- **Better readability**: Cleaner, more organized product lists

### For Data Analysis
- **Quick scanning**: Identify unique products faster
- **Date comprehension**: Understand total coverage period immediately
- **Instance awareness**: Badge shows how many instances exist
- **Drill-down capability**: Access detailed information when needed

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- ✅ Validation tables test passes
- ✅ Modal rendering with grouped products
- ✅ Expandable row functionality

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Open Provisioning Monitor
- [ ] Click on product badge with multiple instances
- [ ] Verify grouped display with instance count
- [ ] Click to expand and view individual instances
- [ ] Verify individual dates display correctly
- [ ] Click to collapse back to grouped view
- [ ] Test with single-instance products (no grouping)
- [ ] Verify validation warnings still appear
- [ ] Test on Account History page
- [ ] Test with different product types (Models, Data, Apps)

## Pages Affected

1. **Provisioning Monitor** (`/#provisioning`)
   - Model Entitlements modal
   - Data Entitlements modal
   - App Entitlements modal

2. **Account History** (`/#account-history`)
   - All product modals in account history table

## Files Modified

- `public/script.js` - Added grouping logic and toggle function
- `public/styles.css` - Added styling for expandable rows
- `Technical Documentation/08-Changelogs/CHANGELOG-Product-Modal-Grouping.md` - This document

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Add "Expand All" / "Collapse All" buttons for large lists
- Store expansion state in localStorage for persistence
- Add sorting by instance count
- Filter to show only multi-instance products
- Export grouped view to CSV/Excel

## Notes

- The total item count in the modal header still shows the ungrouped count (total instances)
- Validation checks still reference original indices for accurate error reporting
- Package info helper icon remains functional on child rows
- Sorting functionality works on the grouped view
