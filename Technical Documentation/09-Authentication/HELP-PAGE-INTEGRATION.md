# Adding Authentication Section to Help Page

## Overview

A complete authentication help section has been prepared in `public/auth-help-section.html`. This needs to be inserted into the main Help page in `public/index.html`.

## Integration Steps

### 1. Open Files
- Source: `public/auth-help-section.html`
- Target: `public/index.html`

### 2. Find Insertion Point
In `public/index.html`, find the section immediately after "Getting Started":

```html
<!-- Getting Started -->
<section id="getting-started" class="mb-8">
    ...
</section>

<!-- INSERT AUTHENTICATION SECTION HERE -->

<!-- Dashboard -->
<section id="dashboard" class="mb-8">
```

### 3. Insert Content
Copy the entire content from `public/auth-help-section.html` and paste it between the Getting Started and Dashboard sections.

### 4. Verify

After insertion, the help page should have this order:
1. 🚀 Getting Started
2. 🔐 Authentication & User Management (NEW!)
3. 📊 Dashboard
4. 🔧 Provisioning Monitor
5. ... (rest of sections)

### 5. Test
- Start the application
- Navigate to Help page (click Help button in sidebar)
- Click "🔐 Authentication & Users" in Quick Navigation
- Verify it scrolls to the authentication section
- Check all content displays correctly

## Navigation Link

The quick navigation link has already been added:
```html
<a href="#authentication" class="text-primary hover:underline">🔐 Authentication & Users</a>
```

## Content Included

The authentication help section covers:
- ✅ Key Features overview
- ✅ Logging in instructions
- ✅ Session management details
- ✅ User management guide (admin only)
- ✅ Role management guide (admin only)
- ✅ Password requirements and changing passwords
- ✅ Account lockout information
- ✅ Permission levels (admin vs user vs custom roles)
- ✅ Best practices
- ✅ Security features
- ✅ Links to admin documentation

## Alternative: Automatic Insertion

If you prefer to insert automatically, use this PowerShell command:

```powershell
# Find the line number of "<!-- Dashboard -->"
$content = Get-Content "public\index.html" -Raw
$authContent = Get-Content "public\auth-help-section.html" -Raw

# This is a simplified example - manual insertion is recommended
# for large files to ensure correct placement
```

## Notes

- The help section is fully styled using Tailwind CSS classes
- All content is responsive and matches the existing help page design
- Color coding:
  - Blue boxes: How-to instructions
  - Yellow boxes: Warnings (account lockout)
  - Green boxes: Best practices
  - Gray boxes: Reference information
- Section anchors use `id="authentication"` for navigation

## Status

✅ Navigation link added to Quick Navigation  
⏳ **Content insertion pending** - See `public/auth-help-section.html`  
✅ Content prepared and styled
