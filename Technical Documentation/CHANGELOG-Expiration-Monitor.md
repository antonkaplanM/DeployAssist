# Expiration Monitor - Changelog

## Version 1.1.0 - October 2, 2025

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed modal data not loading**: Resolved duplicate HTML element IDs (`modal-title` and `modal-content`) that prevented expiration details modal from displaying product data
  - Renamed product modal IDs to `product-modal-title` and `product-modal-content`
  - Updated `showModal()` function to use correct modal elements

- **Fixed incorrect status column**: All items were showing "At-Risk" regardless of actual extension status
  - Updated `salesforce.js` backend logic to default group status to `'extended'`
  - Status only marked as `'at-risk'` if ANY product in the group is not extended
  - Previously defaulted to `'at-risk'` causing incorrect display

- **Fixed data passing issue**: Modal function was unreliably looking up data from global array
  - Changed `showExpirationDetails()` to accept complete item object as parameter
  - Removed array lookup by PS record ID which could fail
  - Ensures reliable data access in modal

### UI Enhancements
- **Updated color scheme** to match specification:
  - Models: Blue badges (`bg-blue-50 text-blue-700`) with ðŸ”µ icon when extended
  - Data: Green badges (`bg-green-50 text-green-700`) with ðŸŸ¢ icon when extended
  - Apps: Purple badges (`bg-purple-50 text-purple-700`) with ðŸŸ£ icon when extended
  - At-Risk: Red badges (`bg-red-50 text-red-700 ring-2 ring-red-600`) with ðŸ”´ icon for all types

- **Enhanced status badges**:
  - At-Risk: Red background with bold ring-2 border for high visibility
  - Extended: Green background with ring-2 border
  - Increased font weight to `font-semibold` for better readability

- **Improved modal category headers**:
  - Color-coded left borders matching product type
  - Dynamic icons based on status (red for at-risk, colored for extended)
  - Text colors match border colors for consistency

### Debug & Logging
- Added comprehensive console logging:
  - `[Expiration]` - Page initialization and data loading
  - `[ExpirationTable]` - Table rendering with status verification
  - `[ExpirationDetails]` - Modal data population
- Logs first 3 items during table render to verify status
- Logs sample item when data loads
