# Customer Products Feature Documentation

## Overview

The **Customer Products** feature provides a comprehensive, region-organized view of all active products for a specific customer account. It aggregates data from all Professional Services (PS) records and displays products grouped by geographic region and category (Models, Data, Apps).

## Location

The Customer Products page is accessible via:
- **Provisioning â†’ Customer Products** in the main navigation
- Direct navigation from Account History page via "View Customer Products" button (if implemented)

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Product Aggregation

**Data Source:**
- Queries all PS records for the selected account from Salesforce
- Parses payload data to extract entitlements
- Aggregates and merges products in real-time on each page load

**Active Products Only:**
- Shows only products where `endDate >= today`
- Expired products are automatically filtered out
- Focus on current customer subscriptions

### 2. Smart Product Merging

**Merging Logic:**
- Products are merged based on: `region + category + productCode`
- Same product across multiple PS records is shown as one entry
- Date ranges are aggregated (earliest `startDate`, latest `endDate`)
- All contributing PS records are tracked and displayed

**DataBridge Exception:**
- DataBridge products can have multiple concurrent instances in the same region
- Each DataBridge instance is shown separately
- Tracked by unique combination: `region + category + productCode + PS record ID`

### 3. Geographic Organization

**Region-Based Display:**
- Products are primarily organized by geographic region
- Common regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, etc.
- Each region displays its own product count
- Regions are collapsible for easy navigation

**Region Cards:**
- Header shows region name and total product count
- Clickable to expand/collapse
- Contains category sections (Models, Data, Apps)
- Visual globe icon for easy identification

### 4. Category Breakdown

**Three Product Categories:**

1. **Models** (Blue color scheme)
   - Analytical models and algorithms
   - Grouped by productCode
   - Shows model names and codes

2. **Data** (Green color scheme)
   - Data feeds and datasets
   - Data entitlements
   - Database products

3. **Apps** (Purple color scheme)
   - Application products
   - Includes PackageName field (shows resource allocation)
   - Web applications and services

**Category Features:**
- Each category is collapsible within its region
- Shows product count badge
- Products sorted alphabetically by productCode
- Color-coded for easy visual distinction

### 5. Product Cards

Each product card displays:

**Essential Information:**
- Product Name
- Product Code (monospace font)
- PackageName (for Apps - indicates resource size)
- Geographic Region
- Active period (startDate â†’ endDate)
- Days remaining until expiration

**Status Indicators:**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Active**: > 90 days remaining (green)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Expiring Soon**: 30-90 days remaining (yellow)
- ðŸŸ  **Expiring**: < 30 days remaining (orange)

**Source Tracking:**
- Lists all PS records that contributed to this product
- PS record IDs are clickable badges
- Links directly to Provisioning Monitor with exact match

### 6. Search and Discovery

**Account Search:**
- Type-ahead autocomplete for account names
- Minimum 2 characters to trigger search
- 300ms debounce for performance
- Shows account names with request counts

**Search Methods:**
- Type account name directly
- Select from autocomplete dropdown
- Press Enter or click Search button

### 7. Summary Statistics

**Account Summary Card:**
- Account name
- Total active products count
- Last updated information (PS record ID and date)
- Category breakdown (Models, Data, Apps counts)
- Quick action buttons

**Action Buttons:**
- **View Account History**: Navigate to chronological PS record view

```

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "account": "Bank of America",
  "summary": {
    "totalActive": 15,
    "byCategory": {
      "models": 8,
      "data": 4,
      "apps": 3

### Frontend Components

**Key Functions:**
- `initializeCustomerProducts()` - Sets up page and event listeners
- `loadCustomerProducts(accountName)` - Fetches data from API
- `renderCustomerProducts(data)` - Updates UI with results
- `renderCustomerProductsRegions(productsByRegion)` - Creates region cards
- `renderCategorySection(name, products, color)` - Creates category sections
- `renderProductCard(product, color)` - Displays individual product
- `toggleRegionSection(regionId)` - Handles region collapse/expand
- `toggleCustomerProductsCategory(categoryId)` - Handles category collapse/expand
- `navigateToProvisioningWithExactMatch(psId)` - Links to source record

**State Management:**
```javascript
currentCustomerProducts = {
    accountName: "Bank of America",
    data: {...} // Full API response
}
```

### Data Aggregation Algorithm

**Step 1: Query PS Records**
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Account__c, Payload_Data__c, CreatedDate, LastModifiedDate
FROM Prof_Services_Request__c
WHERE Account__c = '{accountName}'
ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC
LIMIT 1000
```

**Step 2: Parse and Filter**
- Extract entitlements from `Payload_Data__c`
- Parse JSON structure: `properties.provisioningDetail.entitlements`
- Filter out products where `endDate < today`

**Step 3: Merge Products**
- Create unique key: `region|category|productCode` (or include PS ID for databridge)
- Group products by unique key
- Aggregate: earliest startDate, latest endDate
- Collect all source PS record IDs

**Step 4: Organize by Region**
- Group products by region
- Within each region, separate into categories
- Sort products alphabetically by productCode

**Step 5: Calculate Status**
- Active: daysRemaining > 90
- Expiring Soon: 30 < daysRemaining <= 90
- Expiring: 0 < daysRemaining <= 30

### Performance Considerations

**Real-Time Aggregation:**
- No caching or pre-computation
- Fresh data on every request
- Typical response time: 1-3 seconds
- Scales to ~1000 PS records per account

**Future Optimization Options:**
- Redis caching with TTL
- Background refresh jobs
- Database materialized views
- Incremental updates

## Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Account Summary** (Top level)
   - Shows overall statistics
   - Quick actions

2. **Region Cards** (Primary grouping)
   - Collapsible for focus
   - Geographic organization

3. **Category Sections** (Secondary grouping)
   - Collapsible within regions
   - Color-coded by type

4. **Product Cards** (Detail level)
   - All essential information
   - Clickable source links

### Color Scheme

- **Blue**: Models (analytical products)
- **Green**: Data (data feeds and sources)
- **Purple**: Apps (applications)
- **Status Colors**: Green (active), Yellow (expiring soon), Orange (expiring)

### Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: Full multi-column layout
- **Tablet**: Stacked regions with optimized spacing
- **Mobile**: Single column, full-width cards
- All collapsible sections maintain functionality across devices

## Integration Points

### Account History Integration

**Bidirectional Navigation:**
- Customer Products â†’ Account History: "View Account History" button
- Account History â†’ Customer Products: (Future) "View Customer Products" button

**Complementary Views:**
- Customer Products: Current state, organized by region
- Account History: Timeline view, organized chronologically

### Provisioning Monitor Integration

**Exact Match Navigation:**
- Click PS record badge in Customer Products
- System sets `exactMatchFilter = psId`
- Navigates to Provisioning Monitor
- Shows only the exact PS record (no partial matches)

**Example:**
- Click "PS-89" â†’ Shows only PS-89
- Does NOT show: PS-898, PS-8901, PS-890

### Salesforce Integration

**Data Source:**
- Direct queries to Salesforce via jsforce
- Reads Prof_Services_Request__c objects
- Parses Payload_Data__c JSON field

**Authentication:**
- Uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow
- Token stored in `.salesforce_auth.json`
- Automatic token refresh

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Search returns no results**
- **Solution**: Verify account name is correct (case-sensitive)
- **Solution**: Check if account has any PS records in Salesforce
- **Solution**: Verify Salesforce authentication is valid

**Issue: Products not appearing**
- **Solution**: Check if products have valid end dates
- **Solution**: Verify products are not expired (endDate < today)
- **Solution**: Check payload data format in PS records

**Issue: Duplicate products in same region**
- **Solution**: Expected for DataBridge products (can have multiple instances)
- **Solution**: For non-DataBridge, report as potential bug

**Issue: Region sections not collapsing**
- **Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Solution**: Refresh the page
- **Solution**: Clear browser cache

**Issue: PS record links not working**
- **Solution**: Ensure Provisioning Monitor page is accessible
- **Solution**: Check if PS record exists in Salesforce
- **Solution**: Verify exactMatchFilter is being set correctly

**Issue: Slow page load**
- **Solution**: Expected for accounts with many PS records (>500)
- **Solution**: Wait for aggregation to complete (up to 10 seconds)
- **Solution**: Consider future caching implementation

### Debug Mode

**Enable console logging:**
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
// Reload page
```

**Check API calls:**
```javascript
// In browser console, after loading products
console.log(currentCustomerProducts);
```
