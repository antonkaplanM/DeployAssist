# React Migration Plan - Deploy Assist

## Overview
Migrate from vanilla JS SPA (17,900 lines) to React + JavaScript for better maintainability and developer experience.

## Goals
- âœ… Modern component-based architecture
- âœ… Easier to maintain and debug
- âœ… Preserve all existing functionality
- âœ… Zero downtime migration
- âœ… Keep JavaScript (no TypeScript frontend)

## Current State
- **Frontend:** Single-page vanilla JS app
  - index.html: 4,470 lines
  - script.js: 12,930 lines
  - styles.css: 484 lines
- **Backend:** Express.js (JavaScript + TypeScript versions)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Auth:** JWT-based authentication
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (already set up âœ…)

## Migration Strategy: Phased Approach

### Phase 0: Setup & Preparation (Week 1)
**Goal:** Get React environment running alongside existing app

Tasks:
- [ ] Create `frontend/` directory for React app
- [ ] Initialize React with Vite: `npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react`
- [ ] Install dependencies (React Router, Axios, etc.)
- [ ] Configure Vite to proxy API requests to backend
- [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS in React app
- [ ] Create basic folder structure
- [ ] Test: Hello World React app running on port 3000

**Deliverable:** React dev server running with routing to Express backend

---

---

### Phase 5: User Management (Week 5)
**Goal:** Admin user management

**Priority:** MEDIUM
Components to build:
- [ ] User list/table
- [ ] Create/Edit user modal
- [ ] Change password modal
- [ ] Role management
- [ ] Page entitlements

**Migration from:**
- User management section in `index.html`
- `script.js` user management functions (~lines 12500-13000)

**Deliverable:** Complete user management system

---

### Phase 6: Remaining Features (Week 6)
**Goal:** Migrate remaining pages

**Priority:** MEDIUM-LOW
Pages to build:
- [ ] Customer Products
- [ ] Roadmap
- [ ] Settings
- [ ] Help page

**Migration from:**
- Remaining sections in `index.html` and `script.js`

**Deliverable:** All features migrated

---

### Phase 7: Testing & Polish (Week 7)
**Goal:** Test, fix bugs, optimize

Tasks:
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Fix any bugs found

**Deliverable:** Production-ready React app

---

### Phase 8: Deployment & Cutover (Week 8)
**Goal:** Deploy to production

Tasks:
- [ ] Build React app for production
- [ ] Update backend to serve React build
- [ ] Test production build
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor for issues
- [ ] Archive old `public/` files

**Deliverable:** React app live in production

---

## Technical Decisions

### State Management
- **Global State:** React Context API
  - AuthContext (user, login, logout)
  - NotificationContext (notifications)
- **Local State:** useState/useReducer
- **Server State:** React Query (optional, can add later)

### Routing
- **React Router v6**
- Protected routes for authenticated pages
- Admin-only routes for user management

### API Layer
```javascript
// Centralized API client
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: '/api',
  withCredentials: true,
});

// Add auth interceptor
api.interceptors.response.use(
  response => response,
  error => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Handle auth errors
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

### Component Strategy
- **Functional components** with hooks
- **Composition** over inheritance
- **Small, focused components**
- **Shared components** in `components/common/`

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Run Both Apps During Migration
- Keep old app running on main port
- React app runs on dev port
- Switch routes over incrementally

### Feature Flags (Optional)
- Use environment variables to toggle between old/new features
- Allows partial rollout

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing of each migrated feature
- Automated tests for critical paths (optional)
- UAT with actual users before full cutover

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert backend to serve old `public/` files
2. Keep React branch separate until proven
3. Git tags at each phase for easy rollback

---

## Dependencies to Install

```bash
cd frontend
npm install react-router-dom axios
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… All features migrated and working
âœ… No loss of functionality
âœ… Performance equal or better
âœ… Code is more maintainable
âœ… Easier to add new features
âœ… Team is comfortable with new codebase

---

## Timeline: 8 Weeks

- **Weeks 1-2:** Setup + Core Infrastructure + Dashboard
- **Weeks 3-4:** Analytics + Provisioning
- **Weeks 5-6:** User Management + Remaining Features
- **Weeks 7-8:** Testing + Deployment

**Can be accelerated if working full-time on migration**

---

## Next Steps (Before Implementation)

1. **Review this plan** - Does it match your priorities?
2. **Adjust phases** - Reorder based on business needs
3. **Set aside time** - Block calendar for migration work
4. **Create branch** - Start feature branch
5. **Run Phase 0** - Get React running
6. **Iterate** - Build phase by phase

---

## Questions to Answer Before Starting

1. **Timeline:** Do you need it faster? (Can parallelize some work)
2. **Testing:** Do you want automated tests during migration?
3. **Feature priorities:** Which features are used most? (Migrate first)
4. **Team size:** Solo or multiple developers?
5. **Go-live date:** Is there a hard deadline?
